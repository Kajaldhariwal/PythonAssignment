    "\n",
    "1. Who developed Python programming language?\n",
    "Ans. Python was developed by Guido van Rossum.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Which type of programming does Python support?\n",
    "Ans. Object-oriented programming and structured programming are fully supported, Because is a multi-paradigm \n",
    "     programming language.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. Is Python case sensitive when dealing with identifiers?\n",
    "Ans. Yes, Python is a case-sensitive language, i.e., it treats uppercase and lowercase characters differently.\n",
    "     This applies to identifiers too.\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. What is the correct extension of the python file?\n",
    "Ans. The extensions for Python files are - .py, .pyi, .pyc, .pyd, .pyo, .pyw, and .pyz.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Is python code compiled or interpreted?\n",
    "Ans. Python is a interpreted language.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Name a few blocks of code used to define in Python language?\n",
    "Ans. Module, Function body, Class definition, Each command typed interactively, Script file, Script command,\n",
    "     a module run as a top level script (as module __main__) from the command line using a -m argument is also\n",
    "     a code block. The string argument passed to the built-in functions eval() and exec() is a code block.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. State a character used to give single-line comments in python?\n",
    "Ans. # is used to give single-line comments in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Mention functions which can help us to find the version of python that we are currently working on?\n",
    "Ans. The function sys. version can help us to find the version of python that we are currently working on.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Python supports the creation of anonymous function at runtime, using a construct called.............?\n",
    "Ans. python supports the creation of anonymous function at runtime, using a construct called lambda.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What does pip stand for python?\n",
    "Ans. PIP stands for preferred installer program.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Mention a few built-in functions in python?\n",
    "Ans. Some few built-in functions are: \n",
    "     print( ) function\n",
    "     type( ) function\n",
    "     input( ) function\n",
    "     abs( ) function\n",
    "     pow( ) function\n",
    "     dir( ) function\n",
    "     sorted( ) function\n",
    "     max( ) function\n",
    "     round( ) function\n",
    "     divmod( ) function\n",
    "     id( ) function\n",
    "        \n",
    "12. What is the maximum possible length of an identifier in python?\n",
    "Ans. 79 characters is the maximum possible f an identifier in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. What are the benefits of using python?\n",
    "Ans. Benefits of using python are following:-\n",
    "     1.Third-Party Modules:-\n",
    "       Python Package Index (PyPI) comprises a multitude of third-party modules which makes Python integrate\n",
    "       with other languages and platforms easily.\n",
    "     2.Presence of Libraries:-\n",
    "       Python is fraught with numerous standard libraries that include string operations, internet protocols, web \n",
    "       service tools, Machine Learning libraries, and operating System Interfaces. Open Source and free Python is \n",
    "       free for use even for commercial purposes. Moreover, active developers can contribute by developing modules \n",
    "       and appending them to the existing library.\n",
    "     3.Huge Support Community:-\n",
    "       Due to lack of official technical support for Python is open-sourced has prompted the development of communities\n",
    "       that enrich the resource bank for continued development and adoption of the language.\n",
    "     4.Easy to learn:-\n",
    "       Python is popular for its excellent readability. This means, even a non-programmer\n",
    "       can read and comprehend the uncluttered syntax. The PEP 8 guidelines provide a set of rules to help in \n",
    "       formatting the code.\n",
    "     5.User-Friendly data structures:-\n",
    "       With its built-in data structures, Python can easily construct run-time data structures including Arra Speed\n",
    "       Being expressive and with object-oriented design, Python contributes to increased speed \n",
    "       and productivity even with less amount of coding.\n",
    "    \n",
    "14. How is memory managed in python?\n",
    "Ans. Memory in Python is managed by Python private heap space. All Python objects and data structures are located in a \n",
    "     private heap.This private heap is taken care of by Python Interpreter itself, and a programmer doesn’t have access \n",
    "     to this private heap.Python memory manager takes care of the allocation of Python private heap space.\n",
    "     Memory for Python private heap space is made available by Python’s in-built garbage collector, which recycles \n",
    "     and frees up all the unused memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. How to install python on windows and set path variables?\n",
    "Ans. Install python from this link https://www.python.org/downloads/\n",
    "     After this, install it on your PC. Look for the location where PYTHON has been installed on your PC using tge \n",
    "     following command on your command prompt: cmd python.\n",
    "     Then go to advanced system settings and add new variable and name it as PYTHON_NAME and paste the copied path.\n",
    "     Then look for the path variable, select it's value and select edit\n",
    "     Add a semicolon towards the end of the value if it's not present and then type %PYTHON_HOME%  .\n",
    "    \n",
    "16. Is identation required in python?\n",
    "Ans. The indentation in Python is very important. \n",
