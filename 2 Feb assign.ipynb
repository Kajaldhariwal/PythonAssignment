    "Q1. Explain  with an example each when to use a for loop and a while loop.\n",
    "Ans. The for loop is used when we already know the number of iterations, which means when we know\n",
    "    how many times a statement has to be executed. \n",
    "    That is why we have to specify the ending point in the for loop initialization.\n",
    "    for loop examole:- \n",
    "                     n = [1, 2, 3]  # Initialization\n",
    "                     for i in n:  # Condition and Updation\n",
    "                         print(i)\n",

    "\n",
    "   When we need to end the loop on a condition other than the number of times, we use a while loop.\n",
    "   In this case, it is not necessary to know the condition beforehand. That is why we can give a \n",
    "   boolean expression in the initialization of the loop.\n",

    "                               print(i)\n",
    "                               i += 1  # Updation\n",
    "                        Output:-\n",
