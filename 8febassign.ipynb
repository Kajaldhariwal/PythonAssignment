    "Q1. What is Abstraction in OOps? Explain with an example.\n",
    "Ans. Abstraction is the process of hiding the internal details of an application from the outer world.\n",
    "     Abstraction is used to describe things in simple terms. It’s used tocreate a boundary between the application \n",
    "     and the client programs.\n",
    "        \n",
    "     Abstraction in OOPS:-\n",
    "     objects are the building blocks of Object-Oriented Programming. An object contains some properties and methods.\n",
    "     We can hide them from the outer world through access modifiers. We can provide access only for required functions\n",
    "     and properties to the other programs. This is the general procedure to implement abstraction in OOPS.\n",
    "        \n",
    "     Let's take another example - When we use the TV remote to increase the volume. We don't know how pressing\n",
    "     a key increases the volume of the TV. We only know to press the \"+\" button to increase the volume.\n",
    "     That is exactly the abstraction that works in the object-oriented concept.\n",
    "     syntax:-\n",
    "           from abc import ABC  \n",
    "           class ClassName(ABC): \n",

    "Q2. Differentiate between Abstraction and Encapsulation. Explain with an example.  \n",
    "Ans. Abstraction:-\n",
    "      Abstraction is a process of hiding unnecessary data and showing only relevant data. Out of an ocean of data,\n",
    "      we are only maintaining the transparency of some data to the user. This\n",
    "      important concept in object-oriented programming will reduce the complexity of the code and increases the \n",
    "      readability.\n",
    "        \n",
    "      Encapsulation:-\n",
    "                    Encapsulation is binding the data members with member variables. This will avoid the direct access\n",
    "        of variables,because direct access of variables may violate privacy, and hiding of the implementation will not\n",
    "        be possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Encapsulation minimizes your code’s part revealed to the user. The user can be anyone who uses your published \n",
    "        code or perhaps your code’s remaining part.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Encapsulation works like a protective wrapper that conceals the code and data within the class. That data and \n",
    "        code will be accessed outside the method/member function and the class that is not the members of that class.\n",

    "Q4. How can we achieve data abstraction?\n",
    "Ans. Data Abstraction in Python:-\n",
    "     Data Abstraction in Python can be achieved through creating abstract classes and inheriting them later.\n",
    "     Before discussing what abstract classes are, let us have a brief introduction of inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Inheritance in OOP is a way through which one class inherits the attributes and methods of another class. \n",
    "    The class whose properties and methods are inherited is known as the Parent class. And the class that \n",
    "    inherits the properties from the parent class is the Child class/subclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The basic syntax to implement inheritance in Python is:-\n",
    "        class parent_class :\n",
    "            body of parent class\n",
    "\n",
    "        class child_class( parent_class) :\n",

    "        \n",
    "Q5. Can we create an instance of an abstract class? Explain your answer.\n",
    "Ans. An abstract class cannot be instantiated.\n",
    "\n",
    "     An abstract class may contain abstract methods and accessors.\n",
    "\n",
    "     It is not possible to modify an abstract class with the sealed modifier because the two modifiers have opposite\n",
    "     meanings. The sealed modifier prevents a class from being inherited and the abstract modifier requires a class \n",
    "     to be inherited.\n",
